## Introduction
Gene Ontology (GO) terms provide a standardized vocabulary to describe gene products in terms of their molecular function, biological processes, and cellular components. The multi-label classification of GO terms is a challenging problem due to overlapping functions and complexities in gene sequences. This project utilizes advanced AI methods to tackle this problem.

## Project Objectives
1. Develop a machine learning model for multi-label classification of GO terms.
2. Improve accuracy and efficiency in predicting GO terms based on genomic sequences.
3. Facilitate insights into gene functionality for research and practical applications.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of genomic sequences annotated with Gene Ontology terms. Preprocessing steps include:
- Cleaning and filtering sequences.
- Encoding sequences into a format suitable for machine learning models.
- Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Conversion of genomic sequences into numerical representations using one-hot encoding or embeddings.
2. **Model Design**: 
   - Implementation of a machine learning model capable of handling multi-label classification, such as neural networks.
3. **Training**: 
   - The model is trained using optimized loss functions suitable for multi-label problems.
4. **Evaluation**: 
   - Metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Hamming Loss are used to evaluate model performance.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Biopython
  - NumPy
  - pandas
  - Scikit-learn
  - TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch

## Usage
1. Prepare the dataset by placing it in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the model:
